This repository contains the documentation of a passive underwater device designed to reconstruct the natural soundscape of degraded Mediterranean reefs.   The system uses a geometry-driven water-flow amplifier and three marine-grade aluminium resonant plates, each covering a sub-band of the 150–800 Hz spectrum.
